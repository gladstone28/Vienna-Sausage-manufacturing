        <h1>The HACCP Process</h1>
        <h2>Learn about our safety and quality standards.</h2>
        <p>Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic preventive approach to food safety. It identifies physical, chemical, and biological hazards in production processes that can cause the finished product to be unsafe and designs
            measurements to reduce these risks to a safe level. In the context of the Vienna sausage manufacturing process, let's identify potential HACCP steps:</p>
        <h4>Hazard Analysis:</h4>
        <p>- At the meat selection and preparation stage, hazards might include biological risks (like bacteria in raw meat) and physical risks (like bone fragments).</p>
        <h5>2.Identify Critical Control Points (CCPs):</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat Selection and Preparation: Control the quality of meat and ensure it is sourced from safe, reputable suppliers.</li>
            <li>Mixing and Seasoning: Ensure correct and safe levels of additives and seasonings, especially curing agents like nitrites.</li>
            <li>Curing: Monitor the levels of curing agents and the conditions of curing to prevent chemical hazards.</li>
            <li>Stuffing and Shaping: Ensure that the equipment is clean and the process does not introduce contaminants.</li>
            <li>Cooking and Smoking: This is a critical stage for eliminating biological hazards. Proper cooking temperatures must be maintained.</li>
            <li>Cooling and Trimming: Rapid cooling to prevent bacterial growth; ensure equipment cleanliness.</li>
            <li>Packaging: Packaging materials should be safe and the process should not introduce contaminants.</li>
            <li>Sterilization and Storage: Sterilization (especially in canning) is critical to eliminate microbial hazards and ensure long shelf life.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>3.Establish Critical Limits:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Set specific measurable limits at each CCP, like minimum cooking temperatures and times, maximum allowable levels of certain chemicals, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>4.Establish Monitoring Procedures:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Implement procedures to regularly monitor these critical limits, like temperature checks and chemical residue tests.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>5.Establish Corrective Actions:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Define actions to be taken when monitoring indicates that a CCP is not under control.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>6.Establish Verification Procedures:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify that the HACCP system is working effectively, through methods like regular review of CCP records, testing, and inspections.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>7.Record-Keeping and Documentation:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain detailed records of the HACCP process, including hazard analysis, CCP identification, critical limits, monitoring system, corrective actions, verification activities, and record-keeping procedures. Each of these steps ensures that
                potential hazards are identified, controlled, and monitored throughout the Vienna sausage production process.</li>
