        <h1>The Manufacturing Process</h1>
        <h2>Meat Selection and Preparation:</h2>
        <p>This involves choosing the right types of meat, commonly pork, beef, and sometimes chicken. The meat is cleaned, trimmed of excess fat, and then ground to the desired consistency.</p>
        <h2>Mixing and Seasoning:</h2>
        <p>The ground meat is thoroughly mixed with a specific blend of seasonings, which typically includes salt, garlic, mustard, and various spices. This step is crucial for flavor development.</p>
        <h2>Curing:</h2>
        <p>The seasoned meat mixture is often cured, which involves adding curing agents like sodium nitrite. This helps preserve the sausage, contributes to its characteristic pink color, and adds a distinct flavor.</p>
        <h2>Stuffing and Shaping:</h2>
        <p>The meat mixture is then stuffed into casings. These casings could be natural, like intestines, or synthetic. The sausages are shaped into links by twisting or tying the casing at regular intervals.</p>
        <h2>Cooking and Smoking:</h2>
        <p>The sausages are cooked, often through boiling or steaming, to ensure they're safe to eat. Some varieties are smoked over wood chips to impart a unique smoky flavor.</p>
        <h2>Cooling and Trimming:</h2>
        <p>After cooking, the sausages are cooled to stabilize their shape and texture. Any excess casing is trimmed, and the sausages are prepared for packaging.</p>
        <h2>Packaging:</h2>
        <p>The sausages are either vacuum-packed, placed in jars, or canned. If canned, they are often immersed in a broth to preserve moisture and flavor.</p>
        <h2>Sterilization and Storage:</h2>
        <p>For canned Vienna sausages, the final step is sterilization. The cans are heated to a specific temperature to kill any remaining bacteria, ensuring a long shelf life. The products are then cooled, labeled, and prepared for distribution and storage.</p>
